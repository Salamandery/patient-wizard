## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Getting Started with Create React App.**

    This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.\
    You will also see any lint errors in the console.

    ```shell
    npm test
    ```
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
    See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


1.  **Start building.**

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```
    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
    Your app is ready to be deployed!

    See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## 🚀 Quick start

Here's you will can get some files and configuration you'll can set in the project.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in the project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├──── favicon.ico
    ├──── index.html
    ├──── manifest.json
    ├──── robots.txt
    ├── src
    ├──── components
    ├──── pages
    ├──── hooks
    ├──── index.css
    ├──── index.tsx
    ├──── index.tsx
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .eslintignore
    ├── .eslintrc.json
    ├── prettier.config.js
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`prettier.config.js`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
